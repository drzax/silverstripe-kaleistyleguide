# Kalei style guide for SilverStripe

This is a fork of the [Kalei style guide](https://github.com/thomasdavis/kaleistyleguide) system designed to work with 
[SilverStripe](http://silverstripe.org) themes. 

The Kalei project aims at making sure your style sheets are fully documented. For more information about the Kalei 
project see the [Kalei GitHub repository](https://github.com/thomasdavis/kaleistyleguide).

This is very alpha as far as SilverStripe integration goes.
